/**
 * Farmer Jane
 * Eventually, this will look like a woman farmer driving a tractor. For now,
 * it will be a rectangle. The tractor has an x & y coordinate and size that
 * define its boundaries for collisions with plants.
 * Behaviors:
 * - Starts in the center of the field, pointed in a random direction
 * - Moves at a constant speed
 * - Restricted to moving within the bounds of the field
 * - When she reaches a boundary, she turns either right or left randomly
 * - When she runs over a plant, the plant is harvested or destroyed
 * - Crops are harvested, weeds are destroyed
